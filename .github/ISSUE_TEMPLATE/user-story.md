For example, "As a cat, I need somewhere to hide so that I can avoid the dog invading my personal space."

### Details and Assumptions
  * [Document what you know]

 For example, a possible assumption for this user story might include that the hiding spot should provide sufficient cover for the cat to feel safe.

### Acceptance Criteria
      gherkin
      Given [some context ]
      When [certain action is taken ]
      Then [the outcome of that action is observed ]

The third part includes the definition of "done" so everyone knows when the story can be considered complete. Continuing with the cat user story, the given context might be that the cat and the dog are in the same room when the cat feels threatened by the dog. The observable outcome would be that the cat can find and access its hiding spot.
